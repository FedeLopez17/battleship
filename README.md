# Battleship :ship:

## Description:
<p>
This project is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">The Odin Project's curriculum</a>, and its goal was to practice Test Driven Development.<br>
</p>
<p>
I struggled quite a bit with this project, especially regarding the code architecture and the testing.<br>
I chose to forgo some of the more advanced components of the game I had originally set out to include, such as the PVP mode and making it a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank">Progressive Web App</a>, in order to focus on completing the task at hand and not letting perfect be the enemy of good. I'm happy with how it turned out and I definitely took away some valuable lessons.
